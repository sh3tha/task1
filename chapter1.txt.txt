In the quiet village of Hollowmere, twelve-year-old Mira Thorne discovered a strange key hidden behind the old well's bricks. 
Shaped like a feathered wing and cold to the touch,
 it stirred memories of her father’s lullabies—songs about forgotten creatures and the haunted woods no one dared enter. 
That night, drawn by dreams, Mira returned to the well. Turning the key,
 the earth shifted, the stars vanished, and a hidden path opened into the forest.
 With a mix of fear and wonder, she stepped forward. Hollowmere Woods, long silent,
 had awakened. And Mira was the one it had been waiting for.
